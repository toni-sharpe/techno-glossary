            The TB303 was originally released by <a href='#roland'>Roland</a> in the early 80s intended to replace a bass player so a lead guitarist or singer could practice alone, similar to the thinking behind the <a href='#drum-machine'>drum machine</a>. However, it never took hold in that market and was discontinued by the company.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it's story was not over as innovative musicians started to explore what sounds it could make and how they could be used, freed of the constraints of what it was designed for and created the classic <a href='#acid'>acid sound</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today the original, discontinued run of 303s sell for over £3000 and there are many clones on the market as well as devices capable of doing <a href='#acid'>acid sounds</a> in their own way.

            The 909 was originally a <a href='#drum-machine'>drum machine</a> provided by <a href='#roland'>Roland</a>. It provided <a href='#kick'>bass drum</a>, <a href='#snare-drum'>snare drum</a>, low, mid and hi <a href='#toms'>toms</a>, <a href='#rimshot'>rimshot</a>, <a href='#hand clap'>hand clap</a>, <a href='#open-high-hat'>open</a> and <a href='#closed-high-hat'>closed</a> hi hats, <a href='#open-high-hat'>ride</a> and <a href='#open-high-hat'>crash</a> cymbals.

          </p>
          <p>
            Today the sound still appears across numerous sub-genres of techno while also having made the jump into the general pool of sounds meaning it appears in alt-rock, industrial-metal and even pop music.

            A compressor is a form of <a href='#signal-processing'>signal processing</a> that works by measuring how much a peak in volume goes above a user defined threshold then reducing that peak based on a ratio that the user also sets. Then make-up <a href='#gain'>gain</a> can be used to raise the volume of the whole sound which has been compressed.
          </p>
          <p>
            A ratio of 1:1 has no effect, the peak would not be reduced, whereas a ratio of 2:1 would reduce the peaks to 1/2 of the amount they were above the threshold. <a href='#limiter'>Limiting</a> is an extreme form of compression which works with a ratio of ∞:1 effectively stopping anything going above the threshold at all.

            A kick drum, or bass drum in techno often comes with a punch or kick that isn't wholly bass driven. This can be achieved in endless ways, upping the <a href='#kick'>mid-range</a> <a href='#frequency'>frequencies</a> in the drum sound for more hard attack energy.

            The typical way used in music to describe how many beats make a bar and the size of those beats. The top or first number describes the number of beats in a bar and the second the length of those beats. Techno is mostly 4/4, or 4 beats, each of which is 4 in length, in one bar

          <p>
            Another example is the 3/4 time signature, often used in waltz, a much older form of dance music. Here there are only three beats in the bar with each one being 4 long. 4 is considered to be one beat in the <a href='#bpm'>BPM or tempo</a> of the music. 8 would be twice the BPM, 2 half the BPM and so on.
