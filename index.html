          <p>
            The TB303 was originally released by Roland in the early 80s intended to replace a bass player so a lead guitarist or singer could practice alone, similar to the thinking behind the <a href='#drum-machine'>drum machine</a>. However, it never took hold in that market and was discontinued by the company.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it's story was not over as innovative musicians started to explore what sounds it could make and how they could be used, freed of the constraints of what it was designed for and created the classic <a href='#acid'>acid sound</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today the original, discontinued run of 303s sell for over Â£3000 and there are many clones on the market as well as devices capable of doing <a href='#acid'>acid sounds</a> in their own way.

          </p>
          <p>
            Today the sound still appears across numerous sub-genres of techno while also having made the jump into the general pool of sounds meaning it appears in alt-rock, industrial-metal and even pop music.

Related to <a href='#time-signature'>time-signature</a> the BPM describes how many 4s would fit into one minute. Tempo describes the same thing although there are also a number of older words from classical music that give a rough idea rather than an exact BPM.

            A drum machine is an electronic instrument designed to emulate the sound of drums. Designed originally so bands or individual band members could practice without needing a drummer they have subsequently taken their own distinct space within musical history. Classic examples include the <a href='#drum-machine'>909</a> and <a href='#drum-machine'>Linn Drum</a> machines.

            Frequency is broadly used to describe how rapidly things repeat and can be measured in <a href='#hz'>hz</a> or repetitions per second. In music the frequency is often called tone and tends to be above 15hz.

            In the <a href='#headshell'>headshell</a> on a record player the needle is held precisely so it can read the undulations in the groove of the record. The needle itself is usually made of some extremely hard substance, which is why care is needed concerning the pressure of the needle against the vinyl. Needles, especially on higher end, pro kit are detachable separately from the headshell.

          <p>
            Needles come in various designs and shapes depending on the intended use: for example, heavy scratching hip-hop <a href='#turntablist'>turntablists</a> prefer a needle designed for rougher nature of that playing style when compared to the flowing smooth blend one might hear from a top-tier progressive house DJ.

          <p>
            The typical way used in music to describe how many beats make a bar and the size of those beats. The top or first number describes the number of beats in a bar and the second the length of those beats. Techno is mostly 4/4, or 4 beats, each of which is 4 in length, in one bar
          </p>
          <p>
            Another example is the 3/4 time signature, often used in waltz, a much older form of dance music. Here there are only three beats in the bar with each one being 4 long. 4 is considered to be one beat in the <a href='#bpm'>BPM or tempo</a> of the music. 8 would be twice the BPM, 2 half the BPM and so on.
