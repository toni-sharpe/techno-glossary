          <p>
            BPM is Beats Per Minute and is the standard way to describe the speed of a dance music track. Related to <a href='#time-signature'>time-signature</a> the BPM describes how many 4s would fit into one minute. Tempo describes the same thing although there are also a number of older words from classical music that give a rough idea rather than an exact BPM.

            Detroit, Michigan, US is recognised as one of the earliest places techno became popular. Where people would chose to go out and listen to it specifically and where artists developed who provided the earliest sounds that would become techno.

            The headshell is the lump at the end of the record player <a href='#tone-arm'>tone-arm</a> that houses the <a href='#needle'>needle</a>. Like needles, there's a huge range defined by style of play and preference. Professional headshells detach, with different players often using their own.

          <p>
            A kick drum, or bass drum in techno often comes with a punch or kick that isn't wholly bass driven. This can be achieved in endless ways, upping the <a href='#kick'>mid-range</a> frequencies in the drum sound for more hard attack energy.

          <p>
            The main beat in the typical techno track. In it's most basic form the kick drum is played equally four times per bar, for a 4/4 <a href='#time-signature'>time-signature</a>. Often called bass drum. <a href='#kick'>kick</a> in relation to this drum is subtly different.

          <p>
            Mid range frequencies start roughly at 80-100hz up to 1000 or so. Some good examples are hard metallic synths, vocals, the higher-end punchy kick drums, claps and snares.

          <p>
            In the <a href='#headshell'>headshell</a> on a record player the needle is held precisely so it can read the undulations in the groove of the record. The needle itself is usually made of some extremely hard substance, which is why care is needed concerning the pressure of the needle against the vinyl. Needles, especially on higher end, pro kit are detachable separately from the headshell.
          </p>
          <p>
            Needles come in various designs and shapes depending on the intended use: for example, heavy scratching hip-hop <a href='#turntablist'>turntablists</a> prefer a needle designed for rougher nature of that playing style when compared to the flowing smooth blend one might hear from a top-tier progressive house DJ.

          <h1><a id='time-signature' href='#time-signature'>Time signature</a></h1>
          <p>
            The typical way used in music to describe how many beats make a bar and the size of those beats. The top or first number describes the number of beats in a bar and the second the length of those beats. Techno is mostly 4/4, or 4 beats, each of which is 4 in length, in one bar
          </p>
          <p>
            Another example is the 3/4 time signature, often used in waltz, a much older form of dance music. Here there are only three beats in the bar with each one being 4 long. 4 is considered to be one beat in the <a id='bpm' href='#bpm'>BPM or tempo</a> of the music. 8 would be twice the BPM, 2 half the BPM and so on.

            <p>
              The word <em>track</em> is often used to refer to a full piece of music, for example, an EP might contain three tracks. This usage is somewhat more colloquial to techno or dance music. The word "tune" might be heard more often amongst producers of different genres.

            <p>
              The simplest version would be tracks on a mixer. A DJ mixer with two tracks, one for each deck or a studio mixer, perhaps with 24, where there can be 24 individually manipulated and recorded sources.

            <p>
              The groove cut into vinyl that guides and instructs the needle is also called a track, the needles tracks along the groove, starting a fascinating string of events that convert scratched plastic into the movement and joy of the dance floor.

          <p>
            "Turntablism" is an offshoot of classic DJing that defines the player of the record deck themself to be closer to an instrumentalist than a DJ who plays the works others without even necessarily mixing.
